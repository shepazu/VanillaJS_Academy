# Project: Weight conversion library

For today’s project, we’re going to build a library that developers can use to convert weight from one unit to another.
The Template

This project is entirely JavaScript based (though you can build a UI for it if you’d like to).

When you’re done, you should have a convert library that exposes helper functions that convert weight of one unit to another. To keep the math simple, I would recommend using metric instead of imperial.

- Grams to Kilograms `(grams / 1000)`
- Grams to Milligrams `(grams * 1000)`
- Kilograms to Grams `(kg * 1000)`
- Kilograms to Milligrams `(kg * 1000 * 1000)`
- Milligrams to Grams `(mg / 1000)`
- Milligrams to Kilograms `(mg / 1000 / 1000)`

For example, here’s some JavaScript math for converting grams to kilograms and milligrams.

```js
let grams = 42;
let mgs = grams * 1000;
let kgs = grams / 1000;
```

When the library is completed, you should be able to do this.

```js
// returns 42000
let mgs = convert.gramsToMg(42);

// returns 0.042
let kgs = convert.gramsToKg(42);
```

Note: You do NOT have to format the number as a string with the Number.toLocaleString() method. That was only used for instructional purposes, and surprisingly, that method does not format milligrams as a unit of measure.
